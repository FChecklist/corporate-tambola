// The free demo game: a short, fully preloaded game that runs on the phone page with NO server game behind it.
// It is the real game (same ticket, same number-drawing, same break, same winner check); only the numbers are scripted so a prospective organizer
// sees every part in about 70 seconds: 3 numbers, a 15-second break (their sample video), 3 numbers, and Four corners completed on the 6th number.
// How the script was made: one fixed ticket (seat 1 of the engagement "DEMO"); the 6 numbers are 4 corners and 2 other ticket numbers in an order
// that finishes the corners on the 6th call; DEMO_RAND are the "public random" values that make pickNumber() return exactly those numbers.
// If the ticket generator ever changes again, regenerate the three constants with `bun tools/make-demo-script.ts` (done on 2026-10-10 when the generator was fixed to spread numbers evenly).
// A test (packages/beacon/test/demo-script.test.ts) re-derives everything with the real functions, so this cannot drift from the game.
